Okay just a quick rundown of the arduino, it works, the buttons work, 
the 6 slides are stand ins for the tilt and position x y and z,
just to show that we can interpret those values linearly. 
It works fine, but for the purposes of the controller we just didnt
have a gyroschope to use instead so we just used those as a stand in, 
only later in development did we switch over to accelerometers.
